## JB.TcHmiDynamicPopup for TwinCAT HMI
Nuget package created for version 1.14.3.8

In version 1.12.760.x a new TcHmiPopup control was added to TwinCAT HMI.

Instead of having to add the Popup manually to the view/content this nuget package is dynamically creating a usercontrol/content by calling a javascript function and it will have the same look & feel as the new TcHmiPopup that you can find in the toolbox.

## Usage

The nuget package consists of only one function:

Use the function in any event (for example .onPressed in a button):

Parameters in the function:
 - **popupId:** unique id for the popup (this is used so you dont accidentally open the same popup with the same data-bindings twice)
 - **targetFile:** choose .usercontrol or .content and also link the parameters if it's an .usercontrol file
 - **popupHeader:** header text for the popup
 - **buttons:** additional buttons (such as close-button or other custom ones)
 - **modal:** this will center the popup in the screen and add a darkened background, also not movable
 - **movable:** make the popup draggable
 - **destination:** where the popup should be added. If you are using the Desktop.view just type Desktop
 - **width:** size in px
 - **height:** size in px
 - **left:** position in px
 - **top:** position in px
